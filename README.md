# Command Center


The goal of this project is to compare API implementations in different languages, frameworks and paradigms.
This project sets the API specification (OpenAPI 3.0) and also implements the judging system to validate implementations comply with the spec.

It is also a command center for all actions and updates to implementations.

The main goal is to compare implementaion efforts with the priority to the async servers with few sync implementations as a baseline.
Additionally, the load test can be performed, but the code quality and maintainability is of higher priority. 


## Target project

The target project is a simple web REST API that faces some common functionality.
It should maintain the following entities:
- User
- Forum
- Post
- Comment
- Tag

allow CRUD operations with them and support filtering and pagination.
